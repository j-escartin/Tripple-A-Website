# Tripple-A-Website

A Project in Liferay Development

## Project Overview

The Triple-A (AAA) company was hailed as the best web hosts solutions service company located in downtown Myanmar. They provide a lot of services which includes name registration, Shared Hosting, Reseller Hosting, Cloud Hosting, VPS Hosting,
Dedicated Hosting, and Colocation service, etc. 

The client can order various services from AAA's branch offices through the site and must give personal information such as name, email, address, national identity card number, and contact number. In AAA’s company clients’ data is very important. For them to manage all of the information, it was decided to develop an application with object-oriented approach. The developer is required to build an application that keeps track of their customers’ information and services given to the clients. Having a well-organized customers’ data will help the company to select right recipients for promotion and new services

There will be only one administrator in the portal. The administrator will manage all of the site contents and pages, update the theme and layout, manage the customer data portlet and control permission, and manage all user (Site Member and Customer) roles and permission. There are also site members in the portal that can update AAA company site content and add and update the AAA’s customer data.
